# MVP Discovery Format
# ============================================

discovery_example:
  discovery_id: "auto-generated-uuid"
  fork_id: "circuit-beta-db-001"
  discovery_type: "optimization"
  content:
    summary: "Index on foreign keys improves joins by 10x"
    details:
      problem: "Slow JOIN queries on large tables"
      solution: "CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_id ON orders(customer_id)"
      performance_gain: "Query time: 2.3s â†’ 0.23s"
      applicable_scenarios:
        - "Any foreign key relationship"
        - "Tables over 100k rows"
    code_example: |
      -- Before: 2.3 seconds
      SELECT * FROM orders o
      JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
      WHERE c.country = 'US';
      
      -- Add index
      CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_id ON orders(customer_id);
      
      -- After: 0.23 seconds (10x faster!)
