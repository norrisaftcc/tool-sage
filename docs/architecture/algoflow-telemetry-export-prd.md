# AlgoFlow User Telemetry Export
## Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Required for Launch  
**Owner:** Data Rights & Platform Engineering Teams  
**Moral Foundation:** Users own their data and must be able to access it

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This PRD defines the mandatory user telemetry export feature for AlgoFlow. Every user has the fundamental right to download their complete telemetry data in a portable JSON format. This feature is non-negotiable and must be included in the initial release.

## 2. Core Principle

**"Your workflows, your data, your right."**

Users must be able to:
- Request their complete telemetry data at any time
- Receive it in a standard, portable format (JSON)
- Verify no data is withheld
- Use their data however they choose

## 3. User Stories

### As a User
- I want to download all telemetry data generated by my workflows
- I want the data in a format I can analyze with my own tools
- I want confidence that I'm receiving complete data
- I want to request exports programmatically via API

### As a Team Lead
- I want to export my team's workflow telemetry for custom analysis
- I want to migrate historical data to our internal systems
- I want to verify compliance with our data governance policies

### As a Data Controller
- I want to fulfill user data requests within regulatory timeframes
- I want audit trails of all export requests
- I want to ensure data completeness and integrity

    }
  }
}
```

**Completeness Certificate:**
- Cryptographic proof of complete export
- Signed by platform private key
- Verifiable by users

### 4.5 Performance Requirements

| Export Size | Time Limit | Delivery Method |
|------------|------------|-----------------|
| <10MB | 5 seconds | Synchronous |
| 10MB-100MB | 30 seconds | Synchronous with streaming |
| 100MB-1GB | 5 minutes | Async with notification |
| >1GB | 30 minutes | Async with chunked files |

### 4.6 Access Control

**Authentication:**
- User must be authenticated
- Support for API tokens
- Optional MFA for sensitive exports

**Authorization:**
- Users can only export their own data
- Team leads can export team data (with permission model)
- Admin override with audit trail

### 4.7 Rate Limiting

- 10 export requests per user per day
- 1 active export job at a time
- Configurable limits for enterprise

## 5. Technical Implementation

### 5.1 Architecture

```haskell
-- Export service types
data ExportRequest = ExportRequest
    { erUserId :: UserId
    , erDateRange :: DateRange
    , erFormat :: ExportFormat
    , erInclude :: Set DataType
    , erWorkflowIds :: Maybe [WorkflowId]
    } deriving (Generic, ToJSON, FromJSON)

data ExportJob = ExportJob
    { ejId :: ExportId
    , ejRequest :: ExportRequest
    , ejStatus :: ExportStatus
    , ejCreatedAt :: UTCTime
    , ejCompletedAt :: Maybe UTCTime
    , ejFileLocation :: Maybe FilePath
    , ejError :: Maybe Text
    } deriving (Generic, ToJSON, FromJSON)

-- Export pipeline
exportUserTelemetry :: ExportRequest -> IO ExportJob
exportUserTelemetry request = do
    -- Validate request
    validateExportRequest request
    
    -- Create job
    job <- createExportJob request
    
    -- Process async for large exports
    if estimateExportSize request > smallExportThreshold
        then do
            scheduleAsyncExport job
            return job { ejStatus = Processing }
        else do
            -- Process synchronously
            result <- generateExport request
            return job { ejStatus = Completed
                       , ejCompletedAt = Just now
                       , ejFileLocation = Just result
                       }
```

### 5.2 Data Collection Pipeline

```haskell
-- Efficient data gathering
gatherUserTelemetry :: UserId -> DateRange -> IO TelemetryData
gatherUserTelemetry userId range = do
    -- Parallel fetch from different stores
    (traces, metrics, logs) <- concurrently3
        (fetchUserTraces userId range)
        (fetchUserMetrics userId range)
        (fetchUserLogs userId range)
    
    -- Ensure data isolation
    let filtered = enforceUserIsolation userId (traces, metrics, logs)
    
    -- Generate completeness proof
    proof <- generateCompletenessProof filtered
    
    return $ TelemetryData filtered proof
```

### 5.3 Storage Considerations

**Temporary Export Storage:**
- Encrypted at rest
- Auto-cleanup after 7 days
- Separate from operational storage

**Chunking for Large Exports:**
```json
{
  "export_metadata": {
    "total_chunks": 5,
    "chunk_size_mb": 200
  },
  "chunks": [
    {
      "chunk_number": 1,
      "filename": "export_exp789_chunk_1_of_5.json",
      "checksum": "abc123...",
      "size_bytes": 209715200
    }
  ]
}
```

## 6. Privacy & Security

### 6.1 Data Isolation

**Query-Level Isolation:**
```sql
-- Every query MUST include user filter
SELECT * FROM traces 
WHERE user_id = :user_id 
  AND timestamp BETWEEN :start AND :end
  AND workflow_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM workflows WHERE owner_id = :user_id
  )
```

### 6.2 Encryption

- All exports encrypted with user-specific key
- Optional user-provided encryption key
- Secure download links with expiration

### 6.3 Audit Trail

```json
{
  "audit_event": {
    "type": "telemetry_export_requested",
    "user_id": "usr_123456",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-30T10:00:00Z",
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
    "user_agent": "AlgoFlow-CLI/1.0",
    "export_parameters": {
      "date_range": "2025-01-01 to 2025-01-30",
      "size_estimate_mb": 450
    }
  }
}
```

## 7. User Experience

### 7.1 Export Flow

1. **Request Export**
   - Clear explanation of what will be included
   - Time estimate based on data size
   - Option to filter by date/workflow

2. **Processing**
   - Real-time progress updates
   - Ability to cancel
   - Queue position for large exports

3. **Delivery**
   - Email/notification with download link
   - Clear expiration warning
   - Instructions for verification

### 7.2 Data Usability

**Documentation Included:**
- Schema documentation
- Field descriptions
- Example parsing code
- Import templates for common tools

**Sample Parser:**
```python
# Included with every export
import json

def parse_algoflow_export(filename):
    """Parse AlgoFlow telemetry export."""
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    
    # Verify completeness
    verify_checksum(data)
    
    # Access your data
    for trace in data['traces']:
        print(f"Workflow: {trace['workflow_name']}")
        print(f"Duration: {trace['end_time'] - trace['start_time']}")
        
    return data
```

## 8. Compliance

- Export files available for 7 days
- Audit logs retained per compliance policy

## 9. Testing Requirements

### 9.1 Functional Tests

- Export contains only requesting user's data
- All data types included when requested
- Date range filters work correctly
- Checksum verification passes

### 9.2 Security Tests

- No data leakage between users
- Secure link expiration enforced
- Rate limits properly applied
- Encryption verified

### 9.3 Performance Tests

- 10MB export in <5 seconds
- 1GB export in <5 minutes
- Concurrent exports don't interfere

## 10. Launch Criteria

**Required for Launch:**
- ✓ Basic export functionality
- ✓ JSON format support
- ✓ User authentication
- ✓ Data isolation verified
- ✓ Checksum generation
- ✓ Email delivery
- ✓ API endpoint
- ✓ Documentation

**Post-Launch Enhancements:**
- Additional formats (CSV, Parquet)
- Scheduled recurring exports
- Direct integration with analysis tools
- Incremental exports

## 11. Success Metrics

- 100% of export requests fulfilled
- 0 data isolation violations
- <5 minute average completion time
- >95% user satisfaction score
- <0.1% failed exports

## 12. Open Questions

1. Should we support partial exports if some data is corrupted?
2. How long should we retain export history?
3. Should team exports require approval from all members?
