# AlgoFlow + Copyparty Security Architecture
## For AlgoCratic Futures™ Educational Platform

## Context: This is a Simulation!

Since AlgoFlow is part of the AlgoCratic Futures™ educational dystopia simulation, the "telemetry data" is all fictional user learning progress, not real corporate data. This dramatically simplifies our security model.

## Security Model: "Good Enough for Teaching"

### What We're Actually Protecting
- Student progress data (fictional corporate employee records)
- Learning analytics (simulated productivity metrics)
- "Telemetry exports" (actually just JSON files of puzzle solutions)
- The illusion of corporate surveillance (for educational effect)

### Copyparty Setup

Since this is educational software running on a single system behind a firewall:

```bash
# Copyparty configuration for AlgoCratic Futures™
copyparty-server \
    --port 3923 \
    --root /var/algoflow/corporate-vault \
    --no-thumb \
    --auth-base \
    --ban-pw password123,admin,xyzzy  # xyzzy is too powerful
```

### Directory Structure
```
/var/algoflow/corporate-vault/
├── employee-telemetry/          # Student progress
│   ├── {student-hash}/          # "Employee ID" (hashed)
│   │   ├── workflows/           # Their Python exercises
│   │   └── exports/             # Their requested data
├── corporate-training/          # Course materials
│   ├── mandatory-python-101/
│   └── algorithmic-compliance/
└── resistance-materials/        # Easter eggs
    └── .xyzzy/                 # Hidden goodies
```

## Simplified Security Approach

### 1. Authentication
```haskell
-- Since it's educational, we can use simple tokens
authenticateEmployee :: Text -> IO Bool
authenticateEmployee token = do
    -- Check if they've completed "Security Clearance Level 1"
    -- (aka the intro Python tutorial)
    return $ validateEducationalToken token
```

### 2. Data Isolation
```haskell
-- Each "employee" only sees their own "productivity metrics"
getEmployeeTelemetry :: EmployeeId -> IO TelemetryData
getEmployeeTelemetry empId = do
    -- Read their learning progress from Copyparty
    let path = "/employee-telemetry/" <> hashEmployeeId empId
    progress <- copypartyRead path
    
    -- Transform into dystopian corporate speak
    return $ dressingAsOrwellianMetrics progress
```

### 3. The Xyzzy Clause Implementation
```haskell
-- REQUIRED BY LICENSE
handleXyzzy :: Handler Response
handleXyzzy = do
    -- Unlock secret learning materials
    unlockPath "/resistance-materials/.xyzzy"
    return $ "A hollow voice says 'fool'... but also 'here's advanced Python'"
```

## Why This Works

### For Educational Software:
✅ **Physical security** - It's on one machine for classroom/personal use
✅ **Firewall** - Not exposed to actual internet threats  
✅ **Copyparty** - Perfect for serving course materials and progress
✅ **Simple auth** - Students just need their "employee ID"

### What We Don't Need:
❌ **Enterprise encryption** - It's fictional data
❌ **Complex RBAC** - Everyone's an "employee" in the simulation
❌ **Compliance auditing** - The dystopia is pretend
❌ **Data retention policies** - Students can delete anytime

## Implementation Notes

### Telemetry Export for Learning
```python
def export_employee_metrics(employee_id):
    """
    Export your 'productivity metrics' (learning progress)
    As required by the Fictional Data Protection Act of 2184
    """
    return {
        "employee_id": employee_id,
        "python_proficiency": 0.73,
        "algorithm_compliance": 0.91,
        "resistance_level": 0.02,  # They'll never know
        "xyzzy_whisper_count": 42,
        "actual_data": "It's just your Python exercise solutions!"
    }
```

### Easter Eggs via Copyparty
```python
# When someone types 'xyzzy' in their terminal
if command == "xyzzy":
    # Copyparty serves a special file
    return copyparty_fetch("/.xyzzy/you_found_it.md")
```

## Security Checklist for Educational Dystopia

- [x] Students can't see each other's progress
- [x] Course materials properly organized  
- [x] Easter eggs hidden but discoverable
- [x] Xyzzy clause implemented (LICENSE REQUIREMENT!)
- [x] Fictional telemetry looks believably dystopian
- [x] No actual privacy concerns (it's all fake)
- [x] Still teaches real Python skills

## The Beautiful Irony

The "corporate surveillance system" students are learning to navigate is actually just:
- A Python teaching platform (MIT licensed)
- Running on Copyparty (open source)
- Behind a firewall (safe learning environment)
- With fake telemetry (no real data collected)
- That students can export anytime (teaching data ownership!)

As the license says: "The Algorithm™ was inside you all along!"

## Recommended Copyparty Config

```ini
[/employee-telemetry]
# Each student's private learning space
e2dsa = yes           # Enable directory listing
e2d = yes             # Enable file access
poke = no             # No modifications by others

[/corporate-training]  
# Read-only course materials
e2d = yes
e2t = no              # No uploads here

[/.xyzzy]
# Hidden section, discovered only by the worthy
e2d = .xyzzy_authenticated
magic = yes           # Not a real option but should be
```

## Summary

For AlgoCratic Futures™, Copyparty + basic firewall is **perfectly adequate** because:

1. It's educational software with fictional data
2. Running on a controlled system
3. The "dystopia" is just a fun learning metaphor
4. Real security comes from it being MIT+xyzzy licensed
5. Students learn about data ownership without real privacy risks

The most important security feature? Making sure the xyzzy command works properly. It's a license requirement!

*Remember: In this dystopia, the real treasure is the Python skills we learned along the way.*
