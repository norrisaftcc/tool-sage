# AlgoFlow OpenTelemetry Integration
## Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Draft  
**Owner:** Platform Engineering Team

## 1. Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the integration of OpenTelemetry (OTel) into AlgoFlow to provide comprehensive observability for workflow executions. The integration will enable teams to monitor performance, debug issues, and optimize their algorithmic pipelines while maintaining strict privacy controls.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
- Provide full observability into workflow execution without impacting performance
- Enable root cause analysis for failed or slow workflows
- Maintain user privacy and data sovereignty
- Support both cloud and on-premises deployments

### Success Metrics
- <5% performance overhead from instrumentation
- 100% of workflow executions traced
- Zero PII leakage in telemetry data
- 90% reduction in mean time to identify bottlenecks

## 3. User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want to see which steps in my workflow are slowest
- I want to trace errors back to specific step executions
- I want to correlate logs with traces for debugging
- I want to monitor resource usage per step

### As an Operations Engineer
- I want to set up alerts for workflow failures
- I want to track workflow performance over time
- I want to identify systemic issues across workflows
- I want to export metrics to our existing monitoring stack

### As a Data Protection Officer
- I want to ensure no sensitive data appears in traces
- I want to control what telemetry is collected
- I want audit logs of telemetry configuration changes
- I want data retention policies enforced

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Tracing

**Workflow Spans**
- Create parent span for entire workflow execution
- Include: workflow name, start time, duration, status
- Attach workflow configuration as span attributes

**Step Spans**
- Create child span for each step execution
- Include: step name, dependencies, retry count, cache hit/miss
- Record input/output sizes (not content)
- Track queue time vs execution time

**Span Attributes**
```yaml
workflow:
  name: string
  version: string
  id: uuid
  total_steps: int
  parallelism: int
  
step:
  name: string
  attempt: int
  cached: boolean
  timeout_ms: int
  dependencies: string[]
  input_size_bytes: int
  output_size_bytes: int
  error_type: string (on failure)
```

### 4.2 Metrics

**Workflow Metrics**
- `algoflow.workflow.duration` - Histogram of execution times
- `algoflow.workflow.completed` - Counter of successful completions
- `algoflow.workflow.failed` - Counter of failures
- `algoflow.workflow.active` - Gauge of currently running workflows

**Step Metrics**
- `algoflow.step.duration` - Histogram by step name
- `algoflow.step.retries` - Counter of retry attempts
- `algoflow.step.cache.hits/misses` - Cache effectiveness
- `algoflow.step.queue.time` - Time waiting for dependencies

**Resource Metrics**
- `algoflow.memory.used` - Memory usage gauge
- `algoflow.threads.active` - Active worker threads
- `algoflow.cache.size` - Cache storage size

### 4.3 Logging

**Structured Logging Integration**
- Correlate logs with trace IDs
- Include span context in all log entries
- Support log severity levels
- Configurable log sampling

**Log Format**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-30T10:00:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "Step completed",
  "trace_id": "abc123",
  "span_id": "def456",
  "workflow_id": "wf-789",
  "step_name": "process-data",
  "attributes": {
    "duration_ms": 1234,
    "cache_hit": false
  }
}
```

### 4.4 Privacy Controls

**Data Sanitization**
- Automatic PII detection and redaction
- Configurable field masking rules
- Hash-based anonymization for identifiers
- Sampling controls per workflow

**Configuration**
```yaml
telemetry:
  privacy:
    redact_fields:
      - "email"
      - "ssn"
      - "credit_card"
    hash_fields:
      - "user_id"
      - "session_id"
    sampling:
      default: 1.0
      by_workflow:
        "sensitive-workflow": 0.1
    retention_days: 30
```

## 5. Technical Architecture

### 5.1 Integration Points

```haskell
-- Telemetry module
module AlgoFlow.Telemetry where

data TelemetryConfig = TelemetryConfig
    { tcEnabled :: Bool
    , tcEndpoint :: Text
    , tcHeaders :: Map Text Text
    , tcSampling :: SamplingConfig
    , tcPrivacy :: PrivacyConfig
    , tcExporters :: [ExporterType]
    }

-- Automatic instrumentation via middleware
telemetryMiddleware :: TelemetryConfig -> Middleware IO
telemetryMiddleware config = \action -> do
    span <- startSpan "step.execution"
    result <- try action `finally` endSpan span
    recordMetrics span result
    return result
```

### 5.2 Exporters

Support multiple export targets:
- **OTLP** (OpenTelemetry Protocol) - Primary
- **Jaeger** - For development/testing  
- **Prometheus** - Metrics only
- **CloudWatch** - AWS environments
- **Custom** - User-defined exporters

### 5.3 Performance Considerations

**Async Export**
- Non-blocking telemetry export
- Bounded queues with overflow handling
- Batching for efficiency

**Sampling Strategies**
- Always sample errors
- Probabilistic sampling for success
- Adaptive sampling based on load
- Head-based sampling for trace consistency

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Maximum 5% CPU overhead
- Maximum 10MB memory for telemetry buffers
- Sub-millisecond span creation time
- Graceful degradation under load

### Reliability
