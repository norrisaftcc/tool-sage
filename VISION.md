# SAGE Framework Vision

## Overview

SAGE (Scholar's Adaptive Growth Engine) is not just an adaptive learning application - it's a **framework for building adaptive learning systems** based on the fundamental insight that learning is a graph traversal problem.

## Core Philosophy

### Learning as Graphs

Every learning journey can be modeled as a directed graph where:
- **Nodes** represent learning states or activities
- **Edges** represent transitions based on learner performance
- **Cycles** enable review and reinforcement
- **Branches** provide adaptive pathways

### Agents as Pedagogical Strategies

Each agent in SAGE embodies a specific teaching strategy or learning component:
- **Orchestrator** = Curriculum sequencer
- **Profile Agent** = Learner model maintainer
- **Assessment Agent** = Progress gate keeper
- **Content Agent** = Material adapter

## Framework Architecture

### 1. Composable Learning Graphs

```python
# Define a learning path as a graph
intro_python = LearningPath("Introduction to Python")
intro_python.add_sequence([
    ConceptNode("variables"),
    PracticeNode("variable_exercises"),
    AssessmentNode("variable_quiz"),
    BranchNode("performance_check", {
        "mastered": ConceptNode("functions"),
        "needs_review": ReviewNode("variables_review")
    })
])
```

### 2. Pedagogical Flow Control

The framework provides primitives for common learning patterns:
- **Sequential Learning**: A → B → C
- **Prerequisite Checking**: Ensure A before B
- **Adaptive Branching**: If score < 70%, review
- **Spiral Curriculum**: Revisit concepts with increasing depth

### 3. Learning State Management

```python
class LearningState:
    current_node: Node
    visited_nodes: List[Node]
    performance_history: Dict[Node, Score]
    learner_profile: Profile
    context: Dict[str, Any]
```

## Design Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Content** is separate from **adaptation logic**
- **Assessment** is separate from **instruction**
- **Profile** is separate from **curriculum**

### 2. Extensibility First
- New agents can be added without changing core
- Custom node types for specialized learning activities
- Plugin architecture for content providers

### 3. Observable Learning
- Every transition is trackable
- Learning paths are visualizable
- Analytics hooks at every decision point

## Use Cases

### 1. Adaptive Textbook
```python
textbook = AdaptiveTextbook()
textbook.add_chapter(
    ChapterGraph("Python Basics")
    .with_adaptive_examples()
    .with_skill_gates()
    .with_review_cycles()
)
```

### 2. Intelligent Tutoring System
```python
tutor = TutoringSystem()
tutor.add_strategy(SocraticAgent())
tutor.add_strategy(ExampleBasedAgent())
tutor.add_strategy(ProblemSolvingAgent())
```

### 3. Curriculum Designer
```python
curriculum = CurriculumBuilder()
curriculum.define_prerequisites()
curriculum.add_learning_objectives()
curriculum.generate_adaptive_paths()
```

## Future Capabilities

### 1. Visual Learning Path Designer
- Drag-and-drop interface for creating learning graphs
- Visual debugging of student journeys
- A/B testing different paths

### 2. Learning Analytics Platform
- Track which paths lead to mastery
- Identify common failure points
- Optimize graph structure based on data

### 3. Content-Agnostic Adaptation
- Plug in any content source
- Automatic adaptation based on learner model
- Multi-modal learning support

## Getting Started with SAGE Framework

```python
from sage import LearningFlow, Node, Agent

# Define your learning nodes
class ConceptNode(Node):
    def exec(self, learner_state):
        # Present concept based on learner profile
        pass

# Create your pedagogical agents  
class SpacedRepetitionAgent(Agent):
    def should_review(self, node, last_seen):
        # Implement spaced repetition logic
        pass

# Build your adaptive learning system
flow = LearningFlow()
flow.add_nodes([...])
flow.add_agents([...])
flow.run(learner)
```

## Contributing

SAGE is designed to be extended. Whether you're building:
- New node types for different learning activities
- Agents implementing pedagogical strategies
- Visualization tools for learning paths
- Analytics modules for learning insights

The framework provides the foundation for your adaptive learning innovations.

## Research Foundation

SAGE builds on decades of research in:
- Intelligent Tutoring Systems
- Adaptive Learning
- Graph-based Knowledge Representation
- Cognitive Load Theory
- Mastery Learning

By representing these concepts as composable graph operations, SAGE makes advanced pedagogical strategies accessible to developers.
